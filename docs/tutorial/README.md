# Anvil  Tutorial

In this tutorial we will learn how to use Anvil to write rtl programs with ease, and at the same time check if the program doesnt have any timing violations.


This tutorial walks throught the process of writing programs in Anvil, with the help of examples. Please setup the environment as mentioned in the [README](../README.md) before starting the tutorial.
